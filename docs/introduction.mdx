# Introduction

Verifiable computation is the notion that two parties can jointly execute a program with assurances about the result[^1]. Depending on the design goals of a specific system, verifiable computation may provide properties such as succinctness (verification is cheaper than re-execution), or privacy (certain inputs remain hidden from the other party).

A useful way to think about verifiable computation is to imagine a trusted third party that performs computation perfectly on behalf of two participants who don't trust each other. For a virtual machine -- and specifically the WebAssembly virtual machine -- this means a trusted party that receives inputs from both participants, faithfully executes a program, and relays the correct output back.

Of course, in practice we do not want to rely on a trusted third party. Instead, cryptographic protocols can be applied which allow the two parties to **simulate** such a system while providing very strong assurances that neither party can act dishonestly or cheat. This abstraction separates **what** the computation does from **how** it is securely implemented.

Different settings, such as zero-knowledge proofs or multi-party computation, utilize different cryptographic protocols and have varying capabilities and performance characteristics. This project aims to provide a unified abstraction which provides a number of benefits:

- **Embedder independence** - Developers can write applications which leverage verifiable computation without coupling business logic to a specific embedder.
- **Standard toolchains** - Programs are written in standard languages (C/C++, Rust, etc.) and compiled and tested using standard tools.
- **Standard computation model** - Built on top of an existing, formally specified computation model rather than defining a new one.
- **Standard host interfaces** - Common operations, such as hash functions, are exposed through standard host interfaces, enabling embedder-specific acceleration.

[^1]: The notion of verifiable computation extends to more than two parties, but this project focuses specifically on the two-party setting.
